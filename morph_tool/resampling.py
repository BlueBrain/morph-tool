    """Given a polyline of consecutive points that form segments, it creates
    a new sampling of K points (or point properties) on the same polyline. K
    is determined from the linear density as points per micron.

    Each new point / property is determined via two values: a starting point
    at positional id i in the points array i and a fraction along the segment formed
    by the consecutive points (points[i], points[i+1]). Thus, we have:

    v'[k] = v[ids[k]] + fractions[k] * (v[ids[k] + 1] - v[ids[k]])

    where ids are the positional indices in the points array, corresponding to the
    starting points to which fractions of the segments (v[ids[k]], v[ids[k+1]]) are
    added to reconstruct the new point or property.

    The reason of returning the ids and fractions instead of new points is because
    if instead of points a property is used, such as diameter, it will result to its
    iterpolation on the polyline. Therefore, the result of this function can be used
    to interpolate both points and point properties on a polyline.

            - fractions (np.array): (K-2,) float array of fractions in the
                range [0, 1]

        Using the ids and fractions, the new interior points (without first
        and last) can be created:

        new_points = points[ids] + fractions * (points[ids + 1] - points[ids])

        Similarly, point properties (e.g. diameters) can be interpolated:

        new_diams = diams[ids] + fractions * (diams[ids + 1] - diams[ids])

    Notes:

        It doesn't not return the ids and fractions for first and last points in
        the new resampling, because they should remain unchanged. Therefore, the
        total number of ids and fractions is K-2.
