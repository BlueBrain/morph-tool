    The algorithm is a simplification of:
https://bbpcode.epfl.ch/source/xref/analysis/Pneumatk/pneumatk/__tools__/ \
    Tree/methods/get_apical_point_index.py

    Consider a neuron:

        |   /    | Tuft = 20%
        |--/     |
        |   /
        |--/
        |
    ----.-----

    All endpoints in the top 'tuft_percent' are found, then their common
    branch segment, furthest from the soma, is identified.

    Using the release from 2012 as the base, apical points were compared from
    the annotated versions, and using this algorithm.  Of 239 morphologies that
    were annotated, 48 differed in the apical point choice by more than 1um
    in the y component.  Many of the differences were morphologies that
    shoulnd't have had apical points in the first place (ie: weren't pyramidal
    cells, ex: C050398B-I4.)

    Args:
        neuron (morphio.Morphology): a neuron
        tuft_percent: percentage of the 'height' of the apical dendrite that
        would enclose the tuft, only leaves in this volume are considered as
        endpoints

    Returns:
        neurom.core.point if point is found, or None if it isn't
